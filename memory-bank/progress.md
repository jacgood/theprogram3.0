## Current Status Details
### Completed Work
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** (2025-05-29)
   - Created comprehensive project documentation
   - Established clear project scope and requirements
   - Documented technical architecture and constraints
   - Set up ongoing work tracking system

### Active Work
- **Next Step**: Begin WebDNA framework research
- **Focus Area**: Understanding containerization requirements
- **Priority**: Establishing technical feasibility

### Blocked Items
- None currently identified

## Known Issues and Challenges
### Technical Challenges
1. **WebDNA Containerization**: Proprietary framework with limited container documentation
2. **Large File System**: html/ directory too large for container inclusion
3. **Legacy Dependencies**: Complex integration requirements (Apache2, MySQL, WebCatalog, WebDAV)
4. **Database Migration**: Handling both MySQL and WebCatalog databases

### Risk Factors
1. **WebDNA Compatibility**: Unknown container compatibility issues
2. **Performance Impact**: Container overhead on legacy application
3. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during migration
4. **Business Continuity**: Ensuring zero downtime during transition

## Evolution of Project Decisions
### Initial Approach
- Started with basic "dockerize the application" goal
- Evolved to comprehensive migration strategy with proper documentation

### Architecture Evolution
- **Decision**: Multi-container approach for separation of concerns
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability and scalability
- **Impact**: More complex but more robust solution

### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Comprehensive Memory Bank system
- **Rationale**: Complex project requiring detailed tracking
- **Impact**: Better project continuity and knowledge management

## Success Metrics and Milestones
### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] WebDNA containerization approach defined
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Development workflow established

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic containers running successfully
- [ ] Network connectivity established
- [ ] Volume mounting working

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] WebDNA application accessible in container
- [ ] Database connectivity functional
- [ ] Basic application features working

### Overall Project Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete application functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance equal to or better than legacy system
- [ ] Easy deployment and maintenance procedures
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and procedures
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration

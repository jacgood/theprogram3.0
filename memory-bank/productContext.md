# Product Context: The Program

## What is "The Program"?
"The Program" is a business-critical web application used internally by employees at Good Valuation company. It serves as a core operational tool that the business depends on for daily operations.

## Business Problem Being Solved
The application addresses specific business needs within the valuation industry, providing employees with tools and data necessary for their work processes. The exact functionality is domain-specific to valuation services.

## Current User Experience
- **Access**: LAN-only access via https://www.goodvaluation.com/theprogram
- **Users**: Company employees only (internal tool)
- **Reliability**: Currently stable but at risk due to aging infrastructure
- **Performance**: Functional but constrained by legacy hardware and OS

## Why This Migration Matters
### Business Continuity Risks

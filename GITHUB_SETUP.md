# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Manual Repository Creation Required

The GitHub MCP tool doesn't have sufficient permissions to create repositories automatically. Please follow these steps to complete the repository setup:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `theprogram3.0`
3. Description: `Dockerization project for The Program - migrating legacy WebDNA application to containerized environment`
4. Set to **Public** or **Private** as preferred
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository
After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands in the project directory:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/theprogram3.0.git

# Push the initial commit
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Security
After pushing, verify that sensitive data is NOT in the repository:

### ✅ Should be in repository:
- README.md
- .gitignore
- memory-bank/ directory with documentation
- This GITHUB_SETUP.md file

### ❌ Should NOT be in repository:
- html/ directory (contains sensitive application data)
- *.sql files (database files)
- *.env files (environment variables)
- *.log files (may contain sensitive information)
- *.key files (certificates and keys)
- Any files listed in .gitignore

## Step 4: Configure Repository Settings
1. Go to repository Settings → Security
2. Enable "Vulnerability alerts"
3. Consider enabling "Dependabot alerts" for future dependencies
4. Set up branch protection rules if working with a team

## Security Verification Commands
Run these commands to double-check security:

```bash
# Verify no sensitive files are tracked
git ls-files | grep -E '\.(sql|env|key|log)$' || echo "No sensitive files tracked ✅"

# Verify html/ directory is ignored
git check-ignore html/ && echo "html/ properly ignored ✅"

# Check for any accidentally tracked large files
git ls-files | xargs ls -lh | awk '$5 > 1000000 {print $9 " is " $5}' || echo "No large files tracked ✅"
```

## Next Steps After Repository Setup
1. Update memory-bank/activeContext.md to reflect repository creation
2. Begin Phase 1: WebDNA framework research
3. Use proper commit messages for all future changes
4. Regularly update documentation in memory-bank/

## Troubleshooting
- If you see sensitive files in the repository, immediately remove them and update .gitignore
- If the html/ directory appears in GitHub, check that .gitignore is properly configured
- For large file issues, consider using Git LFS (though we're avoiding this by using .gitignore)

**Remember**: This project handles business-critical infrastructure. Always verify that no sensitive data is committed to version control.
